Service was so, so, but but what really got us was the price of water: Asked for a bottle of sparkling water and got a 750 ml San Pelegr√≠no (that was not on the menu). The bill came with the water at $12, more expensive than wine or beer... Haven‚Äôt seen such a price at really upscale restaurants anywhere, not even at an Airport. Asked the hostess if there was any mistake, and all I got was a smile...",

We walked by the outdoor section and saw at least 4 tables that were empty, clean and had silverware setup. Inside there was also more empty tables. This was irritating. We eventually got outdoor seating and our waitress was great! She was very sweet and accommodating. The menu is small but what i ordered was really good. The atmosphere of this place is fun of the weather is nice it's worth sitting outside for sure.",

We went after the car show and had eggs and bacon just for the candied bacon which had just the right amount of sweet and paired perfectly with each bite of the deviled egg I took. I wish it was pieces chipped on top of the eggs but no real complaints. My dinner was great. my seafood burger was especially good and unique. however the milkshake that I thought was gonna be well worth the money was not. it was a small cup that didn't not taste like a salted caramel milk shake. I got more talk than anything, very like liquor and only small portion. I might be comparing it in my head to another one I have had at a diner in Bethesda  but to me it was lackluster and the other guests at the table shared my sentiments. over all positive experience and if you'd like a good place for well crafted burgers try it out.",

Since it was on the first floor of the hotel, I thought I would check it out. I was not disappointed. First off, I love a good coffee, and they serve a delightful black coffee! Nice roasted flavor, no frills, good price point. Second, their breakfast omelet is exactly what I want from a traditional breakfast diner. A massive portion which is a comforting blanket with eggs/meat/cheese, potatoes, ketchup, and a full belly when I leave. This space was a bit more modern than traditional diners, but that's okay. It's hip, without charging for the hip environment ‚Äî a great spot for breakfast in China Town. You won't be disappointed.",

The servers are knowledgeable of the food so they can help you with any food questions. A bit pricey but definitely worth dinning at least once.",

An hour into being at this establishment one of the waitress informed us that we have to move because someone has bought the section. I asked her why couldn't they be seated else where. There was an entire section to the right of the DJ booth that was available. She stated they wanted our location and paid for it in advance and that we should have never been seated there in the first place. I informed her that sounds like bad management on their part and not something I the customer should deal with. She insisted that we had to move and stood there. I asked my entire party to pick up their hookahs and drinks to move. We went to another table closed out our tabs and left. This was ridiculous that they made is move when 1. we were seated there by their staff. 2. there was another section the people can move to. 3. they didn't compensate or offer any concessions for making us move. Its a billion hookahs spots in dc. I advise you go to another one.",
